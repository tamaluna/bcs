  Beach Cities Solar was founded by Tony Tamalunas in 2010 in response to his own personal residential
	need for which an affordable, properly designed solution was not available. It quickly evolved into 
	commercial projects.

	Tony is a veteran of the aerospace industry starting in the 1960's through 1970's, and of Disney
	Imagineering from the 1980's through 2000's. He has designed everything from satellite electronics
	to ride controls and theme park communication systems and beyond -- not to mention dozens of 
	custom solar solutions!
